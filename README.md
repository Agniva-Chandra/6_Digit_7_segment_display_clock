6-Digit 7-Segment Display Clock Using Arduino This project is a digital clock built using an Arduino microcontroller and a 6-digit 7-segment display to show the time in HH:MM:SS format. The clock keeps track of time using the Arduino’s built-in millis() function, making it a simple and cost-effective solution without the need for an RTC module. Users can manually set the time using push buttons, and the display brightness can be adjusted as needed.

##🎯 Features
✅ Displays time in HH:MM:SS format
✅ Supports 12-hour / 24-hour mode
✅ Keeps time using Arduino’s millis() function
✅ Button-based time adjustment for hours and minutes
✅ Adjustable brightness for different lighting conditions

##🛠️ Components Required
Arduino: Uno, Nano, or any compatible board

#6-Digit 7-Segment Display: Common anode or cathode

#Push Buttons: For setting hours and minutes

#Resistors: As needed for button debouncing

#Power Supply: USB or battery-powered

##⚙️ How It Works
The Arduino uses the millis() function to count elapsed time since the clock was powered on.

The time is displayed in HH:MM:SS format on the 7-segment display.

Push buttons allow the user to adjust hours and minutes.

The display brightness can be adjusted manually or programmed to adapt automatically.

##📚 Code Overview
main.ino: Initializes the display and updates the time every second.

Button handling: Detects button presses to set time.

Display control: Updates digits on the 7-segment display.

##⚡️ Limitations
⚠️ Time resets after power loss, requiring manual reconfiguration.
⚠️ Slight time drift may occur over long durations due to Arduino’s internal clock.

##🚀 Possible Enhancements
✨ Add a battery backup to preserve time after power loss.
✨ Implement an NTP (Network Time Protocol) sync for automatic time updates.
✨ Add an alarm feature with a buzzer for alerts.

##🔢 How a 7-Segment Display Works
A 7-segment display is an electronic display device that shows decimal numbers (0-9) and some letters. It consists of seven LEDs (segments) arranged in a rectangular shape, plus an optional dot (DP) for decimal points.

##⚙️ Basic Structure
A 7-segment display has seven LEDs labeled as:



Each segment (a-g) is an LED that can be turned ON/OFF to form numbers.

The dot (DP) is used for decimal points.

🔌 Types of 7-Segment Displays
There are two types based on how they are wired:

Common Cathode (CC) → All LED cathodes (negative) are connected to GND. You turn ON a segment by sending HIGH (1) to its pin.

Common Anode (CA) → All LED anodes (positive) are connected to VCC. You turn ON a segment by sending LOW (0) to its pin.

Most Arduino circuits use Common Cathode (CC).

##🔢 How to Display Numbers
To show a number, turn ON the necessary segments:

Number	Segments to Turn ON
0	a, b, c, d, e, f
1	b, c
2	a, b, g, e, d
3	a, b, g, c, d
4	f, g, b, c
5	a, f, g, c, d
6	a, f, e, d, c, g
7	a, b, c
8	a, b, c, d, e, f, g
9	a, b, c, d, f, g
For example, to display "3", turn ON a, b, g, c, d.




##🏗 How Multiplexing Works
Multiplexing allows multiple 7-segment displays to share the same segment pins, reducing the number of required pins.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512346af-a9f1-4c0e-ba5d-7101b781c6cb)

All segment pins (a-g) are connected together.

Each digit has a control pin (Common Cathode or Common Anode).

Only one digit is activated at a time, but since it happens very fast, it looks like all digits are ON simultaneously.


##🔗 Multiplexing 6 Pieces of 7-Segment Displays
🛠 How Multiplexing Works
Instead of directly connecting each display's seven segments (A-G) to the Arduino, we share segment pins across all displays and use digit control pins to switch between them rapidly. This creates an illusion of a continuous display due to persistence of vision.

### 1️⃣ **Common Segment Connections (Shared Across Displays)**  

Each segment pin (A-G) is connected to the same Arduino pins:  

| **Segment** | **All Displays Connected to** | **Arduino Pin** |
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| A           | All Displays - Pin A          | 2               |
| B           | All Displays - Pin B          | 3               |
| C           | All Displays - Pin C          | 4               |
| D           | All Displays - Pin D          | 5               |
| E           | All Displays - Pin E          | 6               |
| F           | All Displays - Pin F          | 7               |
| G           | All Displays - Pin G          | 8               |

### 2️⃣ **Digit Control Pins (For Each Display)**  

Each individual display has a separate control pin to turn it **ON/OFF**.  

| **Display (Digit Position)** | **Arduino Pin** |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Digit 1 (Hours Tens)          | 9               |
| Digit 2 (Hours Units)         | 10              |
| Digit 3 (Minutes Tens)        | 11              |
| Digit 4 (Minutes Units)       | 12              |
| Digit 5 (Seconds Tens)        | A0              |
| Digit 6 (Seconds Units)       | A1              |

## 🔥 **Common Cathode vs. Common Anode Displays**  

| **Display Type**       | **Activation Logic**                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 🔹 Common Cathode       | Connect digit control pins to `LOW` to activate. |
| 🔹 Common Anode         | Connect digit control pins to `HIGH` to activate. |

## 🛠️ **Wiring Overview**  

| **Connection**         | **Arduino Pin**         |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| VCC                    | 5V                      |
| GND                    | Ground                  |
| Resistors (220Ω - 1kΩ)  | To limit current to segments |





##🔄 Multiplexing Process
Activate first digit, display a number, then turn it off.

Activate second digit, display a number, then turn it off.

Repeat for all digits very quickly (every ~5ms).

🛠 Wiring to Arduino (Common Cathode Example)
7-Segment Pin	Arduino Pin
a	2
b	3
c	4
d	5
e	6
f	7
g	8
Common Cathode (CC)	GND
For multiple displays, each common cathode is connected to a different control pin (like 9, 10, 11...).

##🏁 Summary
✔️ A 7-segment display has 7 LEDs (a-g) and an optional dot (DP).
✔️ Common Cathode: Segments turn ON with HIGH (1).
✔️ Common Anode: Segments turn ON with LOW (0).
✔️ Multiplexing allows multiple displays using fewer pins.

##🎯 How 6-Digit 7-Segment Display Multiplexing Works
Multiplexing is used to control multiple 7-segment displays with fewer I/O pins by switching them on and off very quickly, so it looks like they are all on simultaneously due to persistence of vision.

##⚡️ How It Works:
Segment Pins Shared Across Displays:

All 6 displays share the same segment pins (a, b, c, d, e, f, g), which reduces the number of required connections.

Each segment pin is connected to all the 7-segment displays in parallel.

Digit Control Pins (Common Cathode/Anode):

Each display has a separate control pin (cathode/anode).

Only one display is turned on at a time by activating its corresponding control pin.

For 6 displays:

digit1, digit2, digit3, digit4, digit5, and digit6 control which digit is ON.

Multiplexing Process:

Display the number on digit1 while keeping the others OFF.

After a small delay (usually 1-5ms), turn OFF digit1 and turn ON digit2, displaying the corresponding digit.

Repeat this process for all 6 digits in a loop.

Due to the rapid switching (typically 1000 Hz), human eyes perceive all digits as being displayed simultaneously.

##🔢 Example:
You want to display 426980:

4 on digit 1

2 on digit 2

6 on digit 3

9 on digit 4

8 on digit 5

0 on digit 6

The Arduino loops through each digit:

Turn ON digit1 → Display 4 → Delay → Clear

Turn ON digit2 → Display 2 → Delay → Clear

… (repeat for other digits)

##⏱️ Timing (Persistence of Vision)
Human eyes can perceive changes slower than ~50ms.

Therefore, refreshing each digit at 1-5ms intervals makes it seem like all digits are constantly ON.

##📡 Advantages of Multiplexing:
✅ Fewer pins required
✅ Saves power
✅ Simpler wiring

##⚠️ Potential Issues:
If delay is too high, flickering occurs.

If current is not controlled, segments can get damaged.
